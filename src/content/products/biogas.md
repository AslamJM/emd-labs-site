title: Integrated biogas production system
---

As the name implies, integrated biogas systems create no trash, relying instead on a synergistic cycle of profit-making activities in which the waste products of one process are used as fuel for the next.
In addition to financial gains, simple, low-cost integrated biogas systems may provide a wide range of options, including rural employment, income diversification, and chances for decentralized services like energy generation, including social and environmental benefits.
