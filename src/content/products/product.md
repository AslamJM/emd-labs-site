### Plastic Upcycling Machines
We construct machinery for upcycling operations such as shredding, injection, extrusion, sheet press, and compression to make upcycled items. It is a social innovation concept that originated in the Open Source community. We design and manufacture our own machinery for the upcycling process.

### IoT Based Smart Agriculture System
In IoT-enabled smart agriculture, We develop a system to monitor farmland using sensors that detect variables such as temperature, light, humidity, and soil moisture. Then, with an IoT Analytics Platform, we automate the irrigation system and enable farmers to monitor their fields from anywhere.

### Smart Hydroponics System
Hydroponics is not only a fun pastime for us, but it is also good for the environment. Hydroponics may save up to 90% of the water required to grow plants in the ground while also increasing yields since the plants always have access to the nutrients they need at any given time. That ensures that fertiliser is kept out of the water table, which is good for the environment.Indoor hydroponics, or hydroponics, is an indoor technique of growing plants that use mineral solutions rather than soil.
### Integrated biogas production system
As the name implies, integrated biogas systems create no trash, relying instead on a synergistic cycle of profit-making activities in which the waste products of one process are used as fuel for the next.
In addition to financial gains, simple, low-cost integrated biogas systems may provide a wide range of options, including rural employment, income diversification, and chances for decentralized services like energy generation, including social and environmental benefits.
