title: Plastic Upcycling Machines
---

We construct machinery for upcycling operations such as shredding, injection, extrusion, sheet press, and compression to make upcycled items. It is a social innovation concept that originated in the Open Source community. We design and manufacture our own machinery for the upcycling process.
