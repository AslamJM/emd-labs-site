title: Bikes for Autistic Kids
---

"We refuse to charge high costs since the cycles are special," the firm states. "We are committed to making our products accessible." The Autistic bikes allow rear-seat caregivers to steer and brake control on a hand-propelled recumbent tricycle for young bikers with mobility difficulties in their legs. Tricycles for children and teenagers with balance concerns are also available from us.
