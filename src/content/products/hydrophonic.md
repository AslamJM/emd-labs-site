title: Smart Hydroponics System
---

Hydroponics is not only a fun pastime for us, but it is also good for the environment. Hydroponics may save up to 90% of the water required to grow plants in the ground while also increasing yields since the plants always have access to the nutrients they need at any given time. That ensures that fertiliser is kept out of the water table, which is good for the environment.Indoor hydroponics, or hydroponics, is an indoor technique of growing plants that use mineral solutions rather than soil.
